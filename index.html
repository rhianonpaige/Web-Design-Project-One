      <h2>The Framework</h2>
      <p>Frameworks can feel a little insulting, because they anticipate your problems and are used by thousands of people. They imply that yours are common, everyday problems, rather than special, amazing mysteries that require a true genius to solve.

      <h2>Debugging</h2>
      <p>Programming is debugging. It’s the expectation that things won’t work. In time, as the relationship between you and a programming language blossoms, you come to realize that what truly characterizes a language is not what it does, but how it tells you what broke.</p>

      <h2>Nothing is Built</h2>
      <p>More months go by. Nothing is built. The old website remains, showing its age, infuriating everyone. Things are said through eye rolls and shrugs in the hallway, in the ordering of addresses in e-mails, and via BCC.</p>

    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>Tests are just code, of course. They check the functions in other code. They run, you hope, automatically, so you can find out if the day’s work you did breaks things or not.

    <h2>Ta-Da! Something Beautiful</h2>
    <p>Version control is software about working, it is a tool for understanding how ideas evolve over time, how mistakes are made and fixed.</p>
